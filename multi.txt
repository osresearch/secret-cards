like two-player, a dealer and N-1 players.
- dealer computes a nonce for each card
- cards should also be self-MAC'ing.
- card = dealer_nonce || value
- set of values are known, set of nonce's are not
- dealer shuffles deck
- dealer deck and the H(dealer_nonce || value) values

each player then, in turn:
- chooses a nonce for each card
- computes their chained hash name, H(nonce_i || H(nonce_j || H(nonce_k || ...)))
- encrypts the card with their key
- shuffles the deck and sends it along with the new names to the next player

final deck reaches the dealer, shuffled and hashed by each party
at this point each player knows their mapping to the previous player's deck,
and the dealer has a set of cards with a final name that includes
every player's nonce.

to deal/draw a card:
- choose a final name (could be dealer or player choice)
  - dealer decrypts the card
  - publishes the decrypted version
- last player looks up the name in their map
  - publishes their nonce and the prior name
  - everyone validates that H(nonce || name) is the expected name
  - publishes the card decrypted with their key
- next player looks up the name, etc
- if this is the destination player
  - do not publish the nonce
  - do not publish the decrypted version
- that way the next player doesn't know the name to lookup
- so the players continue to decrypt all the way around
- player is left with card encrypted with their key
- player decrypts the card, learns dealer nonce
- player knows their nonce and the previous player's name for the card
- can prove they know the card by publishing the value, dealer nonce, their nonce,
and the previous name.

a cheater could try to publish a fake nonce, except that the expected name
would not validate along the way.

a cheater could publish a fake decrypt, the player would detect that
the card name does not appear in the dealer hashes.
if everyone publishes their keys, then it is possible to identify
the cheater (either in the fake decrypt stage or in the initial dealer
stage) (but the game is over).

the player might try to cheat and claim there is an error, but they
can't publish a key that would validate this card.

todo: could there be a round at the beginning to ensure that all of the
dealing stages are correct?  a multi-party cut-n-choose scenario?
